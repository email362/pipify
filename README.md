# Pipify Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is an extremely lightweight way to create picture-in-picture on any site that has a video to play. I found other PiP extensions to be buggy so I decided to create my own. This extension is intended to be supported for as long as it remains in the Chrome Store. It will also remain free and open source for its lifetime as I don't believe in charging people for something that I wouldn't pay for myself. This extension currently has only been tested in the Chrome Browser but I do have plans to test and export it to Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Feel free to message me or make a bug report if anything is not working as intended.

# Usage
After the extension is installed, simply press the Pipify Icon to toggle picture-in-picture on/off.


# ToDo
- Make it work with Amazon Prime Video
